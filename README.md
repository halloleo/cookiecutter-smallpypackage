======================

[Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template for a
Small Python package, forked from
[audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage).

Features
--------

This template is just a lot smaller than  the original

- No docs
- All text files are markdown

Quickstart
----------

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven\'t installed it yet (this
requires Cookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher):

    pip install -U cookiecutter

    (`pipenv install --dev`)

    your project with PyPI.

    config and activate automated deployment on PyPI when you push a new
    tag to master branch.
-   Add the repo to your [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.io/)
    account + turn on the ReadTheDocs service hook.
-   Release your package by pushing a new tag to master.
